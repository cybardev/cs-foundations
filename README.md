# Computer Science Foundations

> [!NOTE]
> In modern times, the field of computer science has evolved to include various peripheral knowledge that universities often skim over or do not teach, but without these students tend to have a hard time. Here we're trying to build an open-source knowledge base with the **bare essentials** of such peripheral knowledge so students can know what to learn, why to learn it, how to learn it, so they're better equipped to learn them on their own.
